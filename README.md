# Machine_Learning_exercises

This is repository made to dive into Machine Learning. After going through theoretical definitions of algorithms, every algorithm is implemented using R and then changed in order to make a coding template. Repository contains extensive exercises on Machine Learning algorithms. Organised into logical parts and programmed in R.

The whole project is organised into 10 parts - in order to understand every aspect of Machine Learning:

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing (+ made a template to use in all the other steps of ML),

Part 2 - Regression (Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression),

Part 3 - Classification (Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification), 

Part 4 - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering),

Part 5 - Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat), 

Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning (Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling),

Part 7 - Natural Language Processing (Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP), 

Part 8 - Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks), 

Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA), 

Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting (k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost)
